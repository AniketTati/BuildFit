# GitHub Issues Management Scripts

This directory contains automated tools for creating and managing GitHub issues for the BuildFit project based on the comprehensive task documentation.

## Files Overview

### Core Scripts
- **`generate_github_issues.py`** - Main parser that extracts tasks from markdown files
- **`generate_creation_guide.py`** - Creates comprehensive guides for issue creation
- **`create_immediate_issues.py`** - Generates priority sequence for immediate action

### Generated Files
- **`github_issues.json`** - Complete structured data of all 206 issues
- **`GITHUB_ISSUES_CREATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete step-by-step creation guide
- **`COMPLETE_ISSUES_LIST.md`** - Detailed list of all issues with full descriptions
- **`IMMEDIATE_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`** - First 30 critical issues to create now
- **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Table summary of priority issues

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate All Issue Data
```bash
# Parse task files and generate issue templates
python scripts/generate_github_issues.py

# Generate comprehensive creation guides
python scripts/generate_creation_guide.py

# Create immediate action items
python scripts/create_immediate_issues.py
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Repository
1. Create milestones:
   - Core Features Development
   - Backend Infrastructure
   - UI/UX Design
   - Testing & QA
   - Deployment & Launch

2. Create labels (with colors):
   - `priority-critical` (#8e44ad)
   - `priority-high` (#e74c3c)
   - `priority-medium` (#f39c12)
   - `priority-low` (#27ae60)
   - `core-features` (#ff6b6b)
   - `backend-tasks` (#4ecdc4)
   - `ui-ux-tasks` (#ffe66d)
   - `testing-tasks` (#95a5a6)
   - `deployment-tasks` (#6c5ce7)

### 3. Create Issues
Start with **`IMMEDIATE_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`** for the first 30 critical issues.

2. Start database and API foundation work
3. Begin brand identity and design system

### Phase 2: Core Development (Week 3-8)
1. Create authentication and user management issues
2. Build workout plan creation features
3. Implement progress tracking
4. Develop UI components

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 9-12)
1. Add social features
2. Implement advanced analytics
3. Complete UI/UX implementation
4. Begin comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (Week 13-16)
1. Execute all testing phases
2. Performance optimization
3. Security auditing
4. User acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Deployment (Week 17-20)
1. Production environment setup
2. App store preparation
3. Launch execution
4. Post-launch monitoring

## Best Practices

### Issue Creation
- Follow the dependency order in the guides
- Use consistent labeling and milestones
- Cross-reference related issues
- Keep descriptions clear and actionable

### Team Coordination
- Assign issues based on team expertise
- Track dependencies carefully
- Use project boards for visual progress
- Regular sprint planning and reviews

### Progress Tracking
- Update issue status regularly
- Document decisions and changes
- Link to pull requests and commits
- Maintain clear acceptance criteria

## Dependencies Management

Many issues have dependencies. Key dependency chains:

1. **Infrastructure → Database → APIs → Frontend**
2. **Brand Identity → Design System → UI Components**
3. **Core Features → Testing → Deployment**
4. **Authentication → User Features → Social Features**

Always create prerequisite issues first and track completion before starting dependent work.

## Customization

### Modifying Task Data
1. Update markdown files in `docs/tasks/`
2. Re-run `generate_github_issues.py`
3. Regenerate guides with updated data

### Adding New Categories
1. Create new markdown file in `docs/tasks/`
2. Follow existing format and structure
3. Update category mappings in scripts
4. Regenerate all files

### Adjusting Priorities
1. Modify priority assignments in task files
2. Update priority order in scripts if needed
3. Regenerate priority sequence

## Integration with Project Management

These scripts work well with:
- **GitHub Projects** - Use generated labels and milestones
- **Jira** - Import issue data via API
- **Asana** - Convert issues to tasks
- **Azure DevOps** - Map to work items

## Support

For questions about these scripts or the issue creation process:
1. Review the generated guides first
2. Check task documentation in `docs/tasks/`
3. Examine the generated JSON data
4. Modify scripts as needed for your workflow
