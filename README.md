To get started on GitHub with the **BuildFit** project, here’s a breakdown of the essential setup and initial files to add:

### 1. **Repository Structure**
   Set up the following folder structure in your GitHub repository:
   ```
   BuildFit/
   ├── README.md
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── app/
   │   ├── assets/             # Images, icons, and other static resources
   │   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components like buttons, cards, etc.
   │   ├── screens/            # Screens (Home, Profile, Workout Plans, etc.)
   │   ├── utils/              # Helper functions
   │   ├── navigation/         # App navigation setup (React Navigation or similar)
   │   ├── hooks/              # Custom hooks for managing state, e.g., fitness tracking
   │   └── App.js              # Main entry point of the app
   ├── docs/                   # Documentation files, images for README, etc.
   └── tests/                  # Testing folder for unit and integration tests
   ```

### 2. **README.md**
   Create an initial `README.md` to outline the project goals, setup, and usage.
