### 1. **Repository Structure**
   Set up the following folder structure in your GitHub repository:
   ```
   BuildFit/
   ├── README.md
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── app/
   │   ├── assets/             # Images, icons, and other static resources
   │   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components like buttons, cards, etc.

   │   ├── utils/              # Helper functions
   │   ├── navigation/         # App navigation setup (React Navigation or similar)
   │   ├── hooks/              # Custom hooks for managing state, e.g., fitness tracking
   │   └── App.js              # Main entry point of the app
   ├── docs/                   # Documentation files, images for README, etc.
   └── tests/                  # Testing folder for unit and integration tests
   ```

### 2. **README.md**
