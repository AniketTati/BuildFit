# BuildFit Core Workout Features - Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision Alignment Summary

Your core vision is:
> **"A simple app where users can run workouts and track them"**
> - See workout plan â†’ Start it â†’ Get step-by-step guidance â†’ Track time and progress
> - Build custom workouts (jumping jack 30s â†’ rest 30s â†’ head rotation 10 â†’ rest 20s â†’ push up 20)
> - Publish and share workouts for others to use and customize

## âœ… What We Have (Foundation Complete)
- âœ… Authentication system with secure login/register
- âœ… Navigation structure and professional UI screens  
- âœ… Redux state management for all app data
- âœ… Database schema for users, exercises, and workouts
- âœ… Backend API for authentication and basic CRUD operations

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Missing Features (The Core App Experience)

### 1. **Workout Execution Engine** - The Heart of the App
**Problem**: Users can see workouts but can't actually RUN them with live guidance

**What We Need**:
- Live workout session screen with step-by-step exercise guidance
- Real-time timers for exercises and rest periods  
- "Next" button progression through workout steps
- Session state tracking (pause/resume/complete)
- Total workout time tracking

### 2. **Workout Builder** - Custom Workout Creation
**Problem**: Users can't create the custom workouts you described

**What We Need**:
- Simple workout creation interface
- Add exercises with custom parameters (reps/time/rest)
- Exercise selection from database + custom exercise creation
- Reorder exercises and preview workout flow
- Save as templates for reuse

### 3. **Workout Sharing & Discovery** - Community Features  
**Problem**: No way to publish or browse community workouts

**What We Need**:
- Publish personal workouts to community feed
- Browse and search other users' workouts
- Copy and customize existing workouts
- Basic social features (like/favorite workouts)

### 4. **Workout Calendar & Analytics** - Long-term Engagement
**Problem**: Users can't track their workout consistency or see progress over time

**What We Need**:
- Calendar view showing workout history with visual indicators
- Daily/weekly/monthly statistics (workouts, calories, time)
- Streak tracking and consistency scoring
- Progress trends and improvement analytics

### 5. **Progressive Difficulty System** - Adaptive Training
**Problem**: Workouts don't adapt to user's improving fitness level

**What We Need**:
- Automatic progression rules (increase reps/time/difficulty over time)
- Performance-based adjustments (faster completion = harder next time)
- User feedback integration (too easy/hard ratings)
- Smart rest period adjustments based on fitness level

### 6. **Effort & Calorie Tracking** - Motivation & Goals
**Problem**: Users can't see the impact of their workouts

**What We Need**:
- Real-time calorie estimation during workouts
- Effort tracking (perceived exertion, intensity scoring)
- Daily/weekly calorie burn goals and progress
- Performance metrics (completion speed, rest usage)
