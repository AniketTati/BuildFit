### Advanced User Flow Examples

**Progressive Difficulty Journey:**
1. User completes a workout in 15 minutes (planned for 20 minutes)
2. App tracks completion speed and asks "How did that feel?" (Easy/Perfect/Hard)
3. User indicates "Easy" - app suggests increasing difficulty for next session
4. Next workout: +2 reps per exercise or -10 seconds rest time
5. Over time, app learns user's progression pattern and auto-adjusts

**Calendar & Analytics Journey:**
1. User opens Progress tab and sees calendar view
2. Calendar shows workout days with color-coded intensity (green=easy, yellow=moderate, red=hard)
3. User taps a day to see workout summary (duration, calories, exercises completed)
4. Weekly view shows consistency metrics (5/7 days worked out, 450 calories burned)
5. Monthly trends show improvement in workout frequency and intensity

### Enhanced UI Components Needed

**Additional Critical Components:**
1. **WorkoutCalendarScreen** - Monthly/weekly calendar with workout history
2. **WorkoutStatsCard** - Daily/weekly/monthly statistics display
3. **ProgressionModal** - Configure automatic difficulty progression
4. **FeedbackModal** - Post-workout difficulty and effort rating
5. **AnalyticsCharts** - Visual progress trends and statistics
6. **CalorieCalculator** - Real-time calorie estimation during workout

### Progression Logic Examples

**Automatic Progression Triggers:**
- **Time-based**: If user completes workout >20% faster than target, increase difficulty
- **Feedback-based**: If user rates workout "Easy" 3 times in a row, auto-increase
- **Consistency-based**: After 1 week of consistent completion, suggest progression
- **Performance-based**: If rest periods are consistently skipped, reduce default rest time

**Progression Types:**
- **Reps/Sets**: Jumping jacks 30 â†’ 35 â†’ 40 over time
- **Duration**: Plank 30s â†’ 45s â†’ 60s progression
- **Rest Time**: 30s rest â†’ 25s â†’ 20s for improved conditioning
- **Exercise Variants**: Push-ups â†’ Incline push-ups â†’ Diamond push-ups

**Calendar & Stats Features:**
- **Workout Heat Map**: Visual representation of workout frequency and intensity
- **Calorie Goals**: Daily/weekly calorie burn targets with progress tracking
- **Consistency Scoring**: Workout frequency percentage and streak tracking
- **Performance Trends**: Charts showing improvement over time (faster completion, higher intensity)
